# OOP Bank Management System (C++)

A fully object-oriented **Bank Management System** implemented in **C++**, designed to simulate real-world banking operations using clean architecture and modular design principles.

This project was developed as an academic software engineering project to demonstrate strong foundations in **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**, problem-solving, and system design.

## Features
- User authentication (Login system)
- Create and manage multiple bank accounts
- Deposit and withdrawal operations
- Currency exchange and transfers
- Secure transaction handling
- Modular and scalable class design (30+ classes)

---

## Technologies Used
- **Language:** C++
- **Programming Paradigm:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
- **Concepts:**  
  - Encapsulation  
  - Inheritance  
  - Polymorphism  
  - Abstraction  
- **Tools:**  
  - Visual Studio
  - Git & GitHub  

---

## System Design
The system is designed using a modular OOP approach where:
- Each real-world entity (Client, Account, Transaction, Bank, etc.) is represented as a separate class.
- Responsibilities are clearly separated to ensure maintainability and scalability.
- Banking operations are implemented from scratch without using external libraries.
